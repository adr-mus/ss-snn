# Semi-supervised siamese neural networks

Siamese networks are used to label new example when we have a large number of classes: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf. 

We focus on designing semi-supervised versions of siamese networks, where we use only small number of labeled examples. 
Example of such method: https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2017/0358.pdf.
